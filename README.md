Purpose of the app 

The purpose of the Meal Suggestion Android App is to help users—especially those with hectic schedules like Hera—choose what to eat depending on the time of day. For breakfast, lunch, or dinner, the app offers a quick and easy way to get meal choices. The software improves convenience and lessens decision fatigue by simplifying meal selections. 

The design considerations 

Simplicity: To guarantee usability, the app has a simple design.  

Input Mechanism: The current time is manually entered by the user, providing flexibility.  

Output Mechanism: Based on the provided time, the app suggests a meal using conditional statements. 

Aesthetic appeal: The UI includes visually appealing elements to make the experience enjoyable. 

Utilasation of GitHub: 

1) Version Control: Github  acts as a robust version control system, enabling developers to track changes, manage multiple branches, and collaborate on projects. Developers can quickly roll back to prior versions if necessary. 

      2)Issue tracking: GitHub provides issue tracking to manage tasks, bugs, and feature requests, which helps streamline project management. 

    3) Repository Hosting: GitHub lets you host your code repository, making it available for cloning and collaboration.

    Github actions:

    1)  Continuous Integration: GitHub Actions can automate the building and testing of your Android application whenever code is pushed to the repository. This helps catch errors early and ensures code quality. 

     2) Automated Testing: Create Actions that will run tests automatically anytime you make a change. This may contain unit and UI tests for your Kotlin code.
